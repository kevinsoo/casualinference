For the last few months, I've been working almost exclusively on my dissertation and other academic research. Great news: I graduated! In July, I'll be starting a position as a Data Scientist at [Civis Analytics](https://civisanalytics.com).

I figured it was time to get back into the habit of writing about side-projects, which would also give me the opportunity to learn and practice new computational methods. I intend to use this blog as a journal to keep track of cool things I'm learning (both methods and insights from the data I analyze).

I've converted my blog to use R's `blogdown` package, which will allow me to publish directly from R Markdown. I'm hoping this will simplify the publishing pipeline and allow me to write more frequently. To start with, I've uploaded my old posts.
