<p><small><em><a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday"><strong>#TidyTuesday</strong></a> is a weekly data project for R users to practice data wrangling and visualization skills. Users work on a new dataset released each Tuesday, and then share their work.</em></small></p>
<p>This week’s edition (<a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-11">Tidy Tuesday 24</a>) is a dataset of meteorite landings from <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/data">NASA</a>. It’s a pretty hectic week for me, so I decided to make a single visualization.</p>
<p>The dataset consists of location data for each meteorite found up until 2013. I wanted to create a visualization that would capture both the geographical and temporal information, so I made an interactive map using the <code>gganimate</code> package. Each point represents the location of a meteorite in a given year, and the size of each point represents the relative mass of the meteorite.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat, size = mass), alpha = .6, color = &quot;darkgoldenrod1&quot;) +

<li id="fn1"><p>I filtered the dataset to include only meteorites found from 1850. In years prior to that, there are very few meteorites in the dataset – this implies that the observation of meteorites was less sensitive back then (as it’s unlikely that meteorites have truly gotten more common over time).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
