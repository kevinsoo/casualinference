<p>In my work as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.civisanalytics.com/">Civis Analytics</a>, I often have to explain the nuances of statistical models to clients without technical backgrounds.</p>
<p>With the recent Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a proliferation of epidemiological data and models being discussed online. Since public sector agencies need to make sense of these models, I wrote <a href="https://www.civstart.org/post/covid-19-data-models-guide-public-sector-officials">a short explainer (published by CivStart)</a> for public sector officials on how to interpret Covid-19 models they might read about. My hope was that this would help them avoid misinterpretations of modeling results.</p>
<p>The full article is linked above, but here is a concise checklist (taken from the post) of things to consider when trying to understand reporting about statistical models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good model should meet all of the criteria below. A negative answer on one isn’t fatal, but a model that fails on multiple counts warrants extra skepticism.*</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Is the model’s methodology clear? Even if the details are too technical to fully grasp, there should be a clear description of how the data is used to generate projections.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the modelers specified the data used by the model? Check if others have reported any issues with the dataset – perhaps it is incomplete, unreliable, or contains bias (does the data represent everyone of interest in your community? Is the sample size large enough?)</p></li>
<li><p>Have the modelers specified the assumptions made by their model? Perhaps a model assumes perfect adherence to social distancing across an entire state. Any assumptions in the model should be reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>Has the data and code behind the model been released so others can replicate and check their work?</p></li>
</ol>
