      <description>More of my work on Census 2020 got mentioned in the Washington Post! The article is about how the current wildfires and hurricanes affecting some states will affect the ability of enumerators to carry out non-response follow-up (NRFU). This compounds the threat imposed by the Trump administration cutting short the window for NRFU. The window is supposed to end September 30 (but there is a lawsuit going back-and-forth in the courts).</description>

      <description>I moved to the DC Metro area in the middle of the months-long Metro shutdown, giving me an immediate taste of the region’s special relationship with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Having lived in cities with varying degrees of public transit options, one long-term project I’d love to tackle is comparing public transit across cities.
Awhile back, I found a public dataset containing reported Metro issues from April 2012 to November 2016.</description>
