      <description>For the last few months, I’ve been working almost exclusively on my dissertation and other academic research. Great news: I graduated! In July, I’ll be starting a position as a Data Scientist at Civis Analytics.
I figured it was time to get back into the habit of writing about side-projects, which would also give me the opportunity to learn and practice new computational methods. I intend to use this blog as a journal to keep track of cool things I’m learning (both methods and insights from the data I analyze).</description>
