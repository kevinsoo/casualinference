      <description>The 2020 Democratic race finally got underway after last week’s first debates (even though it feels like the race has been going on forever). I’ve been absorbing plenty of commentary of how the two nights transpired (including a few more data-centric and analytical pieces).
Not forgetting the gif-able moments.
I downloaded the full debate transcripts from NBC News (posted here and here) and cleaned it up a little to play around with.</description>

      <description>My father passed away on November 17, 2016. His life has been memorialized in countless tributes published in the Malaysian press and on social media. An executive editor at the most widely-read English daily in Malaysia, he had a popular weekly column: Sunday Starters.
As a way of navigating the mourning process, I set out to collect all his writings published in The Star. I’m sure the editors would have given me all his writings if I had asked, but instead I wrote some code to scrape all 366 articles he authored from the website.</description>
