      <description>It’s been awhile since I posted anything, which has been due to my being stretched thin at my job (on top of trying to survive a pandemic). In my work at Civis Analytics, I’ve been monitoring the progress of the census, which determines how federal funding and congressional seats are apportioned to the different states.
In the best of times, the census is a challenging logistical operation to execute well.</description>

      <description>In my work as a data scientist at Civis Analytics, I often have to explain the nuances of statistical models to clients without technical backgrounds.
With the recent Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a proliferation of epidemiological data and models being discussed online. Since public sector agencies need to make sense of these models, I wrote a short explainer (published by CivStart) for public sector officials on how to interpret Covid-19 models they might read about.</description>
