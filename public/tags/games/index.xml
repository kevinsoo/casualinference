      <description>Board games have been a significant part of my life. Many of my closest friendships were forged through repeated gaming sessions. With my friends from high-school, I progressed from simple gateway games like Munchkin to more complex ones like Power Grid. Iâ€™m certainly not alone as a passenger on the board game train.
What makes a good game, and relatedly, what should I play next? BoardGameGeek (BGG) is an online community that helps answer that question with reviews and discussions of almost anything that qualifies as a board/card game.</description>
